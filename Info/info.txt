
live coding with Jupyter

students follow

student give a feedback via sticky notes: green - good to go, red - need help
      at the end, use the notes to put positive and negative responses at the end of the day,
      adjust it to the next day


need to have 2 students at least: if more than 40 people - need 3

the presenter should present, not help students. The second one would address the sticky notes



Scheme of teaching:

I do it
We do it
You do it together
You do it alone



Prectices:
- address by names (use the folded envelopes, ask students to put their names ther)
- contex is the key: students need to know why they learn it, and how they can use it
     bring it up as soon as possible
- first teach the concept, before the syntax

  !!! context and concept - before the syntax !!!

- what is the take-home message 
  Rhetoric device:
  e.g. consistent wording
       "truly I say to you <important message>"

choral response question - it is bad, but if you need to use it, do that:
- give the time to think
- give the answer before call on someone... (we know the answer is "for loop", why don't you explain us why, Julia?)
- think, pair, share
- sticky note response (put on your green sticky)

When teach: need to code and to know what's coming, so..


Don't overwrite things that already exist, better make new cells  - students get confused


Always narrate when you code live

When giving an exercise, write the instructions



The REAL reason to refactor the code via functions:

 it makes the code much easier to test!
